**pe pipeline: split generalization from concrete track record** — `pe-summarizer`'s
"Concrete" section (named projects, specific decisions, what actually shipped) only
lives in per-session files. `pe-synthesizer` folds everything into the 9 trait-taxonomy
profile sections (behavior, values, work style — all generalized-person content), and
`pe-analyzer` is explicitly told not to read session files in bulk. Result: by the
analysis layer, proper nouns and concrete deliverables are gone — heavy on verbs and
adjectives (meta-language about how James works), thin on what was actually built.
Raised 2026-08-18.

- Add a track-record home that survives synthesis: a 10th profile file (e.g.
  `profile/10-track-record.md`) that `pe-synthesizer` populates alongside the 9 trait
  sections — named projects, concrete feats, dates, outcomes, with the same citation
  discipline as the trait sections.
- Split `pe-analyzer`'s output into two tracks: the existing interpretive "what this
  means about the person" read, and a concrete "what was actually built" ledger.
- Touches: `agents/roles/pe-summarizer.md`, `agents/roles/pe-synthesizer.md`,
  `agents/roles/pe-analyzer.md`, `workflows/personal-eval.md`.
- Related: [universal-outcome-metrics-dimension](universal-outcome-metrics-dimension.md)
  — same underlying complaint (verb/adjective-heavy output, thin on measurable
  specifics), applied to project observability instead of the personal-eval pipeline.
